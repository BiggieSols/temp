# CoffeeScript

Add [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) files here. During the build process, they will be compiled (with a `.js` extension) into the `/dev/js/` directory.

**WARNING:** Any files whose names conflict with existing files in the `/dev/js/` directory will be overwritten. For example, `/dev/coffee/index.coffee` will ultimately overwrite `/dev/js/index.js`.
